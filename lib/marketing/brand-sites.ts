// - self: this repo (edge8-web) renders this brand's posts. Only the self brand's
//   posts may appear on this site; everything else is filtered out of the reader.
// - blogEnabled: the brand's site has a live blog that reads these posts. When
//   false (e.g. AI Officer Institute until aio-website ships a blog), publishing
//   is refused with a clear message rather than sending content to a dead URL.
