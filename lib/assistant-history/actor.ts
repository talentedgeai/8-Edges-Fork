// Resolve the signed-in user to a history owner for a given surface, using the

// sessions, so authUserId (= auth.uid()) is a reliable per-user owner key on
// either surface. Returns null when the caller is not authorised for that surface
// (the API route group turns that into a 401). NEVER import from a client component.
