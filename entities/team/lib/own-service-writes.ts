// The own-service write paths for /team, one branch per table so the
// table-ownership gate (scripts/check-table-ownership.mjs) sees every name:
// ideas, equipment_requests, time_off and onboarding_tasks belong to other
// entities, so those go through their owners' writers;
// the rest are this entity's own. A table missing here cannot be written from
// /team, which is the point — reads are allowlisted in data.ts and writes are
// allowlisted here. Split out of data.ts by the 2026-09-05 bug-hunt fixes,
// which found the old `.from(table)` writes invisible to the gate.
