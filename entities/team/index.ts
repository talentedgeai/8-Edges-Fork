// The team entity's front door — the /team workspace: the client hub, time
// off, performance reviews, hiring panels, equipment and
// the team assistant route (docs/engineering/2026-09-03-multi-entity-design.md,
// ME-11).
//
// Everything another entity or app/ is allowed to reach lives behind this file;
// the boundary zones in .eslintrc.entities.json enforce that. What company-os
// and portal consume today — the leave vocabulary, the review engine, the
// contractor emails and the hub panels — resolves through this file only; the
// old `@/lib/...` and `@/components/...` shims went with ME-13.
//
// This is a server-only barrel: the modules below build the service-role
// Supabase client at load. A client component may take a *type* from it; the
// handful that need a value (the admin time-off board, the portal decision
// queue, the hub bands) import the client door, `@/entities/team/client`.
//
// Route bodies (routes/, api/, crons/) are deliberately absent: app/ imports
// those files directly, because Next reads a route's segment config from the
// route file and a page is not a library export.

// AR modules (design §2): each is reached only through its own index.
// The client hub: what a team member sees of the clients they are assigned to.
// It was the last module under modules/ and folded into lib/ with RS-12, which
// retired that directory; coaching and onboarding became their own entities.
