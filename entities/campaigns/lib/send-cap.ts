// and that is the whole point of it being a module: the rule used to live only
// on the personal side, so `email-message-send` could claim a cap "across both
// kinds" that the broadcast cron had no code to uphold — a personal message at
// 08:20 did not stop a broadcast batch at 08:30 (A.15).
//
// The two kinds yield differently, and that asymmetry is deliberate:
//
//   * What has already been SENT today blocks both kinds. This is the half that
//     makes the invariant true, because whichever path sends first blocks the
//     other.
//   * A PENDING broadcast blocks a personal message, and never the reverse. A
//     broadcast is scheduled and approved by a person, so the personal message
//     waits for tomorrow rather than making them the second email of the
//     morning. Broadcasts win a tie, so the two paths cannot deadlock waiting
//     on each other.
//
// Days are company days, the same boundary the Schedule calendar draws.
