// Password sign-in for client contacts is the default, with a magic-link
// (passwordless) alternative plus a self-serve password reset. The link and reset emails are
// sent server-side (see ./actions.ts) through the /portal/verify interstitial:
// corporate mail security (e.g. Microsoft Safe Links) prefetches raw one-time
// links and consumes the token before the person can click, so the emailed
// link must redeem only on a button press. Accounts are never created here —
// they are minted only by an admin invite — and every notice is deliberately
// neutral so the form cannot be used to enumerate who has an account.
//
// The behaviour lives in kernel/ui/LoginForm.tsx, shared with /admin and
// /team; this file is the /portal wiring.
