// The one place that knows how a contractor work request may move.
//
// Before this file the legal moves were string literals spread across five
// call sites in two entities — the admin actions, the portal client helpers,
// the shared decision functions and the contractor's token page — so "can a
// client cancel approved work?" could only be answered by reading all of
// them, and each new status meant finding every literal again. The vocabulary
// (WORK_REQUEST_STATUSES and its labels) stays in company-os, which owns the
// admin presentation of it; what lives here is the *graph*: which status may
// follow which, and which actor is allowed to cause the move. The matrix is
// keyed by WorkRequestStatus, so adding a status to the vocabulary fails the
// typecheck here until its outgoing edges are declared.
//
// The tables are portal's (entities.manifest.json), so the write goes through
// portal's own writer with the caller's filters. Everything that is not the
// status move — the contractor and client emails, the ops Lark ping, the QBO
// billing run, the audit row — stays with the caller and runs after the move
// exactly as it did before.

// Who is causing the move. `contractor` is the holder of the opaque
// access_token on /work/[token] (the bearer link is the credential);
// `system` is reserved for crons and backfills, which cause no move today.
