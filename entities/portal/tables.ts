// Three groups: the survey engine (definitions, fields and the answers a
// respondent submits), the contractor work requests the portal originates and
// decides, and the client roadmap and program documents the portal shares with
// the admin and team client screens. Only the owner writes a table directly;
// the admin-side writes that remain are in scripts/table-ownership-allowlist.json
// with a reason until those screens reach the portal through its index.
