// The portal entity's front door — the client portal, the proposals index, the
// public survey runner, the contractor work-token pages and the /t ticket
// lookup (docs/engineering/2026-09-03-multi-entity-design.md, ME-09).
//
// Everything another entity is allowed to reach lives behind this file; the
// boundary zones in .eslintrc.entities.json enforce that. What company-os and
// team actually consume today is the client-facing backlog and document
// helpers, the contractor work-request state machine and the company-grain
// token accounting; their old `@/lib/...` shims went with ME-13, and this file
// and `client.ts` are the only ways in.
//
// The browser-safe half sits behind `client.ts` rather than this file on
// purpose: the roadmap editors, the document lists and the hub bands that
// import it are client components, and a client component that reached this
// index would pull the work-request and token modules — and with them the
// service-role Supabase client — into its bundle. The same caveat the retreats
// entity records about its UI exports.
//
// Route bodies (routes/, api/) are deliberately absent: app/ imports those
// files directly, because Next reads a route's segment config from the file in
// app/ and a page is not a library export.

// Client documents: the shared program/document store behind the portal's
// Programs tab, the admin company page and the team client hub.

// Contractor work requests. The portal owns contractor_work_* (design §4), so

// here; each caller supplies its own decider and its own guard.

// The transition graph itself: which status may follow which, and which actor
// may cause the move. Every write of `status` on contractor_work_requests goes
// through moveWorkRequest, so the admin actions, the portal helpers and the
// contractor's token page share one answer instead of three sets of literals.
export * from "./lib/work-request-lifecycle";
// Contractor work-request notifications (emails to the contractor and the

// tables, and team sits above portal in the layer order, so the helpers could
// not stay behind team's door without portal reaching up.
