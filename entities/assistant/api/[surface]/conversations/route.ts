// Shared history API for both assistants. `surface` (admin|team) comes from the
// path so identity is checked with the right guard: resolveAssistantActor() uses
// the admin gate for 'admin' and getTeamActor() for 'team', and every store call
// is scoped to that actor's own auth.uid(). One user can never list another user's
// conversations, nor cross the admin/team boundary.

// The route-segment config (runtime / dynamic / fetchCache) is declared by the
// app/ mount, not here: Next reads it by statically analysing the file under
// app/, so a value exported from this module would never be seen. Its note —
// Next 14 freezes fetch, and thus supabase-js reads, in route handlers even
// under force-dynamic — travels with it.
