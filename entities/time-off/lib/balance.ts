// Leave balance arithmetic, computed from a policy's rules
// (plan: private-docs/workflows/private/e8/pto-policies-plan.html).
//
// A policy is a small set of rules: how the service year is counted (calendar
// year or the anniversary of the day probation ended), how often hours post
// (monthly or twice a month), an entitlement per service year that steps up
// with tenure, a carry-over cap applied once a year, and which leave types draw
// from the bank. Everything here is pure: dates in, numbers out, so a test can
// ask "what was this person's balance on a given day" and a page can ask the
// same question for today. Nothing is stored; the ledger is the approved
// time_off rows plus manual leave_adjustments, and the balance is recomputed
// from them on every read.
//
// Hours are the unit inside, because the client policy that motivated this
// accrues 3.34 hours a period; days are hours divided by the policy's day
// length and appear only at the edge, in the numbers a page shows.
