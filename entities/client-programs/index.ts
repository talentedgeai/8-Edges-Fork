// The Client Programs entity's server door (RS-02, spec
// docs/engineering/2026-09-08-pluggable-entities-spec.md): the programme a
// client buys and the roadmap and backlog that track it.
//
// It sits at the bottom of the graph with Contacts because a programme is what
// boards, the admin roadmap screens and the client portal all hang work off:
// three entities read it and none of them may import each other. Its screens
// still live in company-os and portal and move here in a later slice; what
// moved first is ownership of the tables, because Boards could not become an
// entity while they belonged to Portal, which renders boards.

// The client roadmap vocabulary: backlog priorities and statuses, the roadmap
// group and item shapes, the starter template and the pure helpers over them.
// It describes this entity's own tables (client_backlog_items,
// client_roadmap_groups), which is why it moved here from portal with RS-04 —
// portal, the admin roadmap screen and the team client hub all render it, and
// an entity cannot sit below the vocabulary of its own rows.
export * from "./lib/client-backlog";
// The program document store: the shared upload/link/delete primitives and the
// row shape behind the portal's Programs tab, the admin company page and the
// team client hub. program_documents moved here with RS-04 — the documents hang
// off an AI program, which this entity owns.
export * from "./lib/client-documents";
// The roadmap writes as one value, for the three server pages that render the
// editors: they hand these down as a prop so the client door never reaches a
// "use server" module (ui/roadmap-actions-contract.ts has the reasoning).
