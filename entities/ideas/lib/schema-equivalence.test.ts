// The json_schema each of ideas's model calls sent until A.4, kept verbatim
// so the schema derived from the Zod that replaced it can be proved equal.
//
// Transcription is the risk this whole card is about: a slip yields a schema
// that is valid but wrong, which no golden snapshot can catch, because a
// snapshot pins what the Zod emits and not that the Zod says what was there
// before. `canonicalSchema` normalises the two spelling differences it knows
// about (the nullable form, and `required` order) and nothing else.
//
// Delete a fixture when "what it used to be" stops being the question. Not
// before.
