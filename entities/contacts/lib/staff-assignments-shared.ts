// The browser-safe half of staff assignments: the role vocabulary and the row
// shapes, with no reader beside them. lib/staff-assignments.ts imports the
// service-role client for its reads, so a "use client" component that took
// ASSIGNMENT_ROLES from there — or from the entity's server barrel, which
// re-exports it — pulled the whole data layer into the browser bundle. The two
// assignment cards in company-os import from this entity's client door instead,
// and the server module re-exports everything here so nothing else moves.

// Client-visible role titles offered in the assign dropdown. Curated so the
// label a client sees on their team is consistent; edit this list to change it.
