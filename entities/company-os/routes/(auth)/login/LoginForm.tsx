// Password sign-in for admins is the default, with a magic-link (passwordless)
// alternative plus a self-serve password reset. The link and reset emails are
// sent server-side (see ./actions.ts) through the /admin/verify interstitial:
// corporate mail security (e.g. Microsoft Safe Links) prefetches raw one-time
// links and consumes the token before the person can click, so the emailed link
// must redeem only on a button press. Accounts are never created here — they
// exist only on the admin allowlist — and every notice is deliberately neutral
// so the form cannot be used to enumerate who has an account.
//
// The behaviour lives in kernel/ui/LoginForm.tsx, shared with /team and
// /portal; this file is the /admin wiring.
