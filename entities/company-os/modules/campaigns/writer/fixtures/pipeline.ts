## The speed of the model is the point

Fable 5.1 will work for a day on a brief. The model ran **6 hours** on one brief and built on every unstated assumption it found. ${para(6, "Speed")}

## Four things the model needs from you

**42%** of pilots stall, and the median brief is **7 lines** long. Every's review found that **3 of 4** briefs had no definition of done. ${para(6, "Four")}

### Goal, with the reason

${para(5, "Goal")} The goal names the outcome and the reason behind it.

### Guardrails

${para(5, "Guardrail")} Guardrails are the lines the model must not cross.

### Definition of done

${para(5, "Done")} A definition of done is the evidence that proves the work.

### Budget

${para(5, "Budget")} A budget covers time, money, effort and autonomy.

## The Other 50%

${para(6, "Other")} Delegating to a model is the other half of leadership.

## Try it on one process

Pick one process your company runs every week and write the four things down. ${para(5, "Try")}`;
