// month's cadence actually happened, what the roster's commitments came to,
// how far apart the conversations have drifted, and how many goals carry a
// number — plus, since K.56, the two the disclosure under the tiles reveals:
// what else a goal is missing besides its number, and how the 1-1s that did

// THE RULE THIS TYPE EXISTS TO ENFORCE. No field below names, keys or orders a
// person, and none may ever be added that does. Every figure counts a thing —
// a meeting, a commitment, a goal — over the whole roster, so there is no
// value here that a screen could sort people by. `daysSince` is the one array,
// and it is a bag of numbers in ascending order precisely so that its
// positions carry no identity: the chart drawn from it is a shape, and the
// coach who sees two dots drifting has to read the rows below to learn who,
// which is the humane order to learn it in. A sorted bar chart of the same
// numbers with names on it is a ranking of people by neglect and is banned.
// This is the same enforcement-by-return-type the Revenue hub uses
// (`entities/crm/lib/revenue-metrics/shared.ts`, and CLAUDE.md, "their row
// types carry no person column, which is where the rule is enforced").
