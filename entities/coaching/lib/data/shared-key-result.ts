// "You're not alone on this bet" (L.5): the other people whose goals lift the
// same company key result as yours.
//
// The whole design of this file is one decision, and it lives in the TYPE.
//
// A key result with several people climbing towards it is, mechanically, a
// leaderboard waiting to happen: add one number to each row — a percentage, a
// current value, a count of bumps — and a shared bet becomes a ranking of
// colleagues, which is the thing this codebase refuses to build. So
// `SharedGoal` carries a name and a goal title and NOTHING ELSE. There is no
// numeric field to sort by, no progress to render, and no way for a later
// caller to add one without editing this type and reading this comment.
//
// It is the same technique the Revenue hub uses: the absence of a person
// column in the row type is what makes the rule impossible to break by
// accident later.
