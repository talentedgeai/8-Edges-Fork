// The two reads and one write behind the roster's action bar (K.57). They live
// here rather than in one-on-ones.ts because that file is at its size cap, and
// because they belong to one another: the bar's undo window and the bar's
// drawer are both "the row does it without a page load".

// Undo a mark-held done from the roster row, inside the toast's window.
//
// The window is deliberately narrow in what it will reverse. Only a booking the
// daily pass had already stamped as missed can be un-held, and only while it
// carries none of the things a real meeting leaves behind — a recap, a
// published recap, a transcript. That is exactly the row the bar's "Mark it
// held" wrote, and nothing else: a 1-1 that was genuinely held and written up
// can never be reopened by a stray click on a stale toast.
//
// One thing the undo cannot restore: the coach's private voltage note, which
// every path that closes a 1-1 clears by design (K.23), because nothing about
// the coach's state before the hour should outlive it. Restoring it would mean
// carrying that private line through the browser to put it back.
