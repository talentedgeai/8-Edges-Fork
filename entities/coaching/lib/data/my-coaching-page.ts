// Everything /team/my-coaching shows, in one call (A.11).
//
// This assembly used to live in the route body, where nothing could test it:
// a Next route function has no interface, so the eleven facts derived here were
// reachable only by rendering the page. The coach's side has had the deeper
// shape since it was written — getCoachProfileDetail returns one object and its
// route is seventy-four lines — and this is the member's half of that shape.
//
// It composes getMyCoaching rather than extending it. The team hub calls that
// primitive too and reads six of its two dozen fields; folding a whole page
// model into it would make the hub pay for a page it does not render.
//
// TWO FACTS THE PAGE NEEDS ARE NOT HERE, and both are pinned by a boundary rule
// rather than by preference:
//   - the open review cycle, because its fetch crosses into team and coaching
//     may never import team (team requires coaching, not the reverse). A route
//     body sits outside the door graph, which is the only place that import is
//     legal.
//   - the goals panel, because it renders a component under routes/, which
//     lib/ may not import.
// Both stay in the route. Splitting either one's pure half out to live here
// would buy nothing and would invite a later edit to "finish the job" and trip
// the entity gate.

  //     prep, turned to html once here rather than in the browser.
  //   the goal ladder: the rung paragraph is the coach's guidance where there
  //     is some — the top growth priority's detail, else what the member wrote.
  //   the shared bet (L.5): who else is lifting the company key result this
  //     member's goal ladders to. A goal laddering to nothing asks nobody.

  //     read off the Workboard on the same Saigon cut-off the notes use.
