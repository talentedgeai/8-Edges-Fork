// What /team/my-coaching computes about a member, pinned before A.11 moved it.
//
// This mocks the data modules the page model composes rather than the Supabase
// client, deliberately. The entity's chainable fake keeps an ordered queue per
// table, and this composition reads a dozen-plus tables with several read more
// than once; a test coupled to consumption order would fail the moment those
// reads are allowed to run concurrently, which is the next ticket's whole job.
// The reads themselves move verbatim and cannot change. What had no cover at
// all — and what this locks — is the assembly: which fact is derived from which
// input, and where the cut-offs fall.
//
// Every assertion is on a VALUE, never on the shape of the object carrying it,
// so regrouping the return can change the paths below without touching a single
// expected result.
