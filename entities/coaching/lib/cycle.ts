// Team Coaching Cycle — the daily pass (docs/plans/2026-07-25-team-coaching-cycle.md).
// Mirrors lib/onboarding-cycle.ts: one bearer-authed cron walks every active
// coaching profile and runs four steps, each idempotent so a missed day
// self-heals:
//   1) Prep: the rhythm assumes itself. A stale next date rolls forward by
//      the cadence (see cadence.ts) and is written back, so nobody books the
//      next 1-1 by hand and the coach pauses the profile to stop it. Then, a
//      1-1 is coming up (<= 4 days) -> make sure the scheduled row exists and
//      generate the AI prep once (stamped via prep_generated_at).
//      Every prep made in the pass goes to its coach as a single digest at the
//      end of the run, one email listing all of them, not one per person.
//   2) Pre-meeting nudge: four days before the next 1-1 -> one link-only
//      message asking for ninety seconds on the agenda, recorded on
//      coaching_checkins ("one per cycle" = the idempotence, and that row is
//      also what the member's form writes into).
//   3) Trends: a new latest summarized 1-1 -> one report across the last few
//      1-1s, once per 1-1 (the coaching_trends row carrying that 1-1's id is
//      the stamp). It is stored for the coach page and mailed to nobody.
//
// Everything runs on the service-role client; the only caller is the cron
// route. Emails go through sendTransactionalEmail (fail-soft).
