// Coach adoption watch (K.9): the step that notices a rhythm has stopped.
//
// Two nudges, both to the coach, both weekly:
//   - overdue: members whose last 1-1 is further back than their cadence plus
//     three days of grace, and who have no future date booked;
//   - cold roster: a coach with an active roster older than thirty days on
//     which no 1-1 has been held at all — the coaching never started.
//
// "Once a week" needs a stamp, and the cheapest honest stamp is the calendar:
// the step only runs on a Monday (the Saigon date the cron passes in), so a
// coach can be nudged at most once per week without a column, a table or a
// per-coach timestamp to keep in sync. A missed Monday waits for the next one,
// which is the right cadence for a nudge about a fortnightly rhythm.
//
// The two findings fold into ONE message per coach when both apply: a coach
// who is behind on two people and has never met a third should read one note,
// not two.
