// One FAST goal as a card (K.62). The tab used to be the admin skin — a blue
// chip, a measure line in muted grey, an Edit/Delete row and the discussion in
// a separate block further down — and Khoa's verdict was that the method the
// goal is built on could not be read off the screen at all.
//
// So the card IS the method. One dominant element (ui-ux-pro-max priority 6,
// a single modular scale: exactly one display-size number per view) — the
// goal's own number over the mint bar — and under it the four letters as four
// short labelled lines, each carrying the one fact that letter is about. The
// discussion sits on the F line behind a disclosure rather than open, and Edit
// and Delete sit behind a "…" menu rather than in the reading order:
// ui-ux-pro-max priority 8, "progressive disclosure", against the anti-pattern
// "overwhelm upfront".
//
// The bar, the bump and the moment are GoalProgress', shared with the Today
// ladder's goal rung, and the number uses the rung's own `.coach-display`
// classes, so the two screens are the same object seen twice.
