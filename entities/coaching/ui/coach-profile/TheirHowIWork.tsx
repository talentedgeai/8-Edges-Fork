// Read-only, and that is the feature rather than a limitation: these four
// columns are the rare coaching rows the MEMBER owns. A coach who could edit
// them would be writing someone's self-description for them, which is the same
// move this codebase keeps refusing — and it would quietly turn a personal
// manual into a second OCEAN read.
//
// Nothing is shown until the member writes something. An empty frame on the
// coach's page would read as the member having failed to fill a form in, when
// the form is optional and most people will fill it in slowly.
