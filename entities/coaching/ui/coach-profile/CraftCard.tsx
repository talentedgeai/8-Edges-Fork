// The two coach-craft diagnostics, on the tab a coach reads while preparing the
// next 1-1 (K.47). They used to sit as columns on the roster, where they read
// as a score against each person; here they sit beside the conversation they
// describe, each with the one sentence that says what it means and why it is
// worth a glance before the meeting.
//
// Neither figure describes a person. The mode split describes how one
// conversation was spent, and the loose root is the coach's own read of what
// holds somebody here — the sentences say so out loud, because a bare
// percentage next to a name is exactly the thing this product does not do.
