// The four tiles about the coaching practice (K.54, K.55), drawn as inline SVG
// from tokens only. A server component: nothing here has state, and nothing
// here is hoverable, so there is no reason to ship it to the browser.
//
// Every tile passes the two tests from the redesign (§C.2): the unit it counts
// is a thing — a meeting, a commitment, a goal — and sorting the roster by it
// would not produce a league table of people, because there is nothing
// per-person to sort. `PracticeFacts` has no person column, which is where the
// rule is actually enforced; this file must never take a second prop that has
// one. No tile names anybody, no cell or dot carries a tooltip, and no tile
// uses a red or a warning colour: a red state on a coaching page is a metric
// describing a person by another route (CLAUDE.md, "No metric describes a
// person").
//
// Charts are chosen from ui-ux-pro-max `charts.csv`: the bullet chart from row
// 18 "Performance vs Target (Compact)" (`risk:low`, "space-constrained
// contexts where a gauge is too large"), the waffles from row 19
// "Proportional / Percentage" (`risk:low`, "showing what fraction of a whole
// is filled … in a visually engaging and accessible format"), and the dot
// strip from row 17's secondary option "Beeswarm" — that row's own caveat,
// "fewer than 20 data points per group (distribution is not meaningful)",
// rules out the box plot for a roster of six. Each tile carries `role="img"`
// and a sentence `aria-label`, so the shape is never the only way to read it
// (skill priority 1, and priority 10's "relying on color alone to convey
// meaning").
