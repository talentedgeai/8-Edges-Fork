// to the page and make them bump their own number, and it can only do that if
// the rung above the goal shows the movement rather than a static relationship.
//
// The highlight is one-time by construction, not by storage: the class goes on
// after mount, so the animation plays once per visit and nothing is written
// anywhere to remember that it played. It is a movement on the page, never a
// badge or a count that sits there afterwards. Under prefers-reduced-motion the
// CSS drops the animation and the line simply is there.
//
// Every number here belongs to the company key result. Nothing says who moved
// it, and nothing about the member is measured by it.
