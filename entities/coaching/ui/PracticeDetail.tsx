// The second row of practice tiles, behind a disclosure and collapsed at every
// width (K.56). A server component, like the four tiles above it: a `<details>`
// opens and closes without a line of JavaScript, so the page that a coach opens
// before a 1-1 stays entirely server-rendered.
//
// Why these two are behind a fold rather than on the row. Both answer a
// second-order question — the four tiles say what the practice looks like, and
// these say what to do about the part of it that is off. A coach opening the
// page on a Monday wants the first four; a coach sitting down to fix their
// cadence wants these. That is the shape the skill's `progressive-disclosure`
// rule describes (quick-reference §8: "Reveal complex options progressively;
// don't overwhelm users upfront"), and the reason the answer is a disclosure
// rather than a phone-only breakpoint: on a desktop the six tiles would be the
// same wall, one row lower.
//
// The no-ranking rule that governs `PracticeTiles` governs this file exactly as
// hard. `PracticeFacts` has no person column, both tiles count things — goals
// and bookings — over the whole roster, and neither may ever take a second prop
// that carries a person (CLAUDE.md, "No metric describes a person"). A missed
// 1-1 in particular is never attributed here: the only place one is attached to
// a name is the row's own sentence, where it is an offer to rebook.
