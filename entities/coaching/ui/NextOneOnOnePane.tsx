// the page rather than a list of every pane's props.
//
// It carries the `coach-prep` anchor (K.53), and where that anchor points
// depends on what the member can actually do: with a meeting booked, preparing
// means writing the agenda, and with no date yet it means proposing one. The
// next step's sentence says which, so the anchor lands on the thing the
// sentence asked for either way.
