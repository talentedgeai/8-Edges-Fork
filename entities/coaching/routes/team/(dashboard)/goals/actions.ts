// Own-service FAST goal writes for /team/goals. Every mutation re-derives
// ownership inside lib/coaching/data.ts (my* = team_member_id is the actor's
// own), so a forged goal id buys nothing. Manager email + Lark fire only after
// the write succeeds, and never block it.

// What the MEMBER's goal actions accept (ticket 13). These three live under
// routes/ rather than lib/, which is how the entity-wide parse pass counted
// sixty-seven actions in an entity that has seventy.
//
// The shape is the coach tier's zGoalInput (goal-actions.ts) field for field,
// because both tiers are fed by the same FastGoalForm. It is copied rather
// than imported because goal-actions.ts is a "use server" file, and such a
// file may export nothing but async functions, so its schema cannot be
// reached from here.
//
// Both tiers now spell quarterLabel as the canonical QUARTER_PATTERN. The
// coach tier's copy had been re-typed as /^\d{4}Q[1-4]$/ with no hyphen, which
// refused every label quarterLabelFor produces, so its add and update failed
// for every coach and manager from #1447 until this branch. That is the cost of
// a shape described twice, and the reason this file describes it a third time
// only until the shared-schema question is settled.
//
// The domain rules stay in validateGoal (data/my-goals.ts): that a goal must
// ladder up to a company goal, and the 200-character title it enforces, are
// decisions about what a goal IS. This says only that the payload arrived
// intact, which is the half nothing was checking.
