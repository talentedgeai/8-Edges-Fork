// Two things are assembled HERE rather than in that module, both because a
// boundary rule pins them to a route body (A.11):
//
// The review cycle, because team requires coaching, so coaching may never
// import team, and a route body is the one place outside the door graph where
// that import is legal. The coach profile route does the same for the review
// history table.
//
// The My FAST goal tab renders the same MyGoalsPanel that /team/goals renders
// (spec 2.6, one form everywhere). It is composed HERE because the panel's
// server actions live under routes/ and ui/ may not import them; the view takes
// the rendered panel as a node.
