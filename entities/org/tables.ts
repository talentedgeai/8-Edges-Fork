// The Supabase tables the org entity owns (design §4; RS-09).
//
// Org is Edge8's own shape: who works here (team_directory and the
// current_team_members view), how they are organised (departments, positions),
// what the company is aiming at (objectives, key_results, kr_logs, strategies,
// core_values), what it is on paper (company_information, company_profile,
// legal_entities, service_lines), what each person is qualified for
// (person_qualifications), the kit they hold (equipment and its assignments and
// requests) and the survey engine end to end (surveys, survey_fields and the
// responses and answers the portal runner writes through its writers).
//
// Ownership means this entity is the only one that writes them directly;
// scripts/check-table-ownership.mjs ratchets everyone else's reads and fails an
// unlisted cross-entity write. The names here and the `tables` array for org in
// entities.manifest.json are the same list.
