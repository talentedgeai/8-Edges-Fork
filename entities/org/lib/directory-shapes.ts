// Row shapes for two company_os reads that a higher-layer entity loads but a
// company-os component renders: the org chart (team_members) and open
// headcount (job_requisitions). The third, both sides of a client account,
// moved to entities/contacts with the staff-assignments reader (RS-04). The loaders live where the gate lives — /team's are in
// entities/team, the admin's companyId-scoped mirror is in
// entities/crm/lib/company-hub.ts — but the shape belongs to
// company-os, which owns the tables.
//
// They live here because the layer order runs company-os (2) below team (5): a
// file in company-os's door graph may not import team's door, not even for a
// type, or the first value that follows the type is a cycle. team re-exports
// all three from its own door, so its importers are unchanged.

// The org chart: names, roles and departments (no contact details), plus
// manager_id and employment_type so a page can assemble the reporting tree and
// label contractors.
