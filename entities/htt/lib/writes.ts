// The writes other entities may make to htt's tables (multi-entity
// design §4; ME-13). Only the owner writes its tables directly; everyone else
// calls one of these through the entity's index, so the table-ownership gate
// (scripts/check-table-ownership.mjs) sees no raw cross-entity write. Each
// writer is the verb of the statement its caller used to build inline — it
// returns the PostgREST builder so the caller keeps its own filters, select
// and error handling, and moving the call here changed no behaviour. A
// caller that needs more than a filter belongs in this entity as a function.
