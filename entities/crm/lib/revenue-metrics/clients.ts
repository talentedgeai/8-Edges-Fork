// Who the money comes from and what it cost to earn (RF-2, RF-4, 2026-09-14).
//
// One aggregate serves three renderings — the concentration tile, the "Revenue
// by client" bars on Billing, and the clients revenue-and-margin table — so
// the three can never disagree about what a client was billed. The cost half
// comes through finance's one door (`loadDeliveryCost`); this file does no
// cost arithmetic of its own.
//
// The honesty rule this file exists to keep: a margin is a number only for a
// row whose OWN cost is attributed, and only when the cost read succeeded.
//
// Per-row matters more than it sounds. Attribution is deliberately partial —
// the column starts empty and fills by hand — so a single global "we have some
// cost" flag would flip every untagged client to a perfect margin the moment
// one expense anywhere got tagged. "No cost recorded" and "cost not attributed
// yet" are indistinguishable from here, and both must read unknown: printing
// 100% for a client nobody has tagged is the exact lie this file exists to
// prevent, and 100% is not even amber.
//
// An AGGREGATE needs a stricter rule than a row, and for the opposite reason.
// A kind row's cost is non-zero as soon as ONE client in it is tagged, while
// its billed column carries every client in it, tagged or not — so a per-row
// test would let "Project · billed $300k · cost $10k · 97%" sit above three
// client rows, two of which read unknown. An aggregate therefore shows a
// margin only when EVERY client contributing to its billed total has cost
// attributed. Until then it says unknown and reports how much billing has no
// cost behind it, which is the number that says how far the tagging has to go.

// Above this share of the period, one client is a concentration risk and the
// tile turns amber. One constant, read by the tile's tone and by its note.
