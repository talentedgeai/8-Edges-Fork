// Stripe webhook — the payment truth this repo has been missing: until now
// orders were written as 'pending' at session-create time and never
// confirmed. Handles two shapes:
//
//  1. Event registrations (session.metadata.type === 'event_registration',
//     created by /events/[slug]): completed → order 'paid' + registration
//     pending_payment → registered + ticket email; expired/failed → seat
//     released (registration cancelled, order expired).
//  2. Everything else with a session id we stamped (saigon-private private
//     sessions, legacy flows): the order found by stripe_session_id is
//     flipped pending → paid/expired. No registration side effects.
//
// Idempotent by construction: every write is guarded by the row's current
// status (or by a lookup of what a previous delivery wrote), so Stripe
// redeliveries and out-of-order events are no-ops. The fulfilment steps live
// in ./fulfilment.ts — a route module may only export HTTP methods, and the
// steps are what the tests exercise (./fulfilment.test.ts).
//
// Operator setup: add a webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard pointing at
// /api/stripe/webhook with checkout.session.completed,
// checkout.session.expired, checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded and
// checkout.session.async_payment_failed, then set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
// (prod) / STRIPE_WEBHOOK_TEST_SECRET (dev) from the endpoint's signing
// secret.
