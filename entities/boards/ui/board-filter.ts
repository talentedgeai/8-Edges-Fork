// boards, and on a many-board scope their cards merge into the same lanes, so
// the toolbar offers a second cut by board. It is offered only where it says
// something the client filter cannot: when the boards in view include a client
// with more than one board. On a many-client scope the client filter is the
// first cut, so the boards on offer are the chosen clients' and there is
// nothing to offer until a client is chosen; a one-client scope (a hub tab,
// the portal) offers every board straight away. An empty list hides the filter.
