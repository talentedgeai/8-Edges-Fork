// The single entry path for every board mutation.
//
// Before this file, twenty server actions each hand-wrote the same three steps:
// fetch the row to learn its board, call `boardActorFor`, and turn a null actor
// into DENIED. Three of those steps are policy, not plumbing, and writing them
// twenty times meant the answer to "does a non-member learn this row exists?"
// was decided twenty times — and decided differently, because each site had its
// own "Card not found." / "Sprint not found." / "Epic not found." message that
// it returned *before* the actor was known. A stranger with a task id could
// therefore probe for existence on any board.
//
// `boardMutation` decides it once: a row that is missing and an actor who is
// denied both come back as DENIED, so a caller who may not touch the board
// learns nothing from the difference. A read that *fails* is still distinct —
// "could not load" is not "not found", and the user must not go hunting for a
// row that is still there — which is the one behaviour the old sites had to be
// told (only move-card checked it), and now every site inherits.
//
// It is a guard in the sense scripts/check-action-auth.mjs means: it is listed
// in that script's GUARDS, so an action whose first statement is a
// `boardMutation` await is gated, exactly as one that awaits `boardActorFor`.
