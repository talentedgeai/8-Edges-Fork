// The retreats entity's client door (multi-entity design §3, "two doors per
// entity", ME-13). ./index.ts pulls the service-role Supabase client and the
// ticket signer, and a barrel is bundled whole, so a "use client" component may
// never import it. This file is the other door: only browser-safe code is
// re-exported here (client components, types, constants, pure helpers), and
// scripts/entity-client-doors.test.mjs walks its import graph to prove nothing
// server-only follows it into the browser.
//
// What is here is what client components outside the entity consume today: the
// event vocabulary the admin events screens edit, and the people tagger the
// admin gallery manager and the team gallery browser share. knip reports an
// export nothing imports.
