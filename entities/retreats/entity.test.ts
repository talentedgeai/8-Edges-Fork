// ME-06 — the retreats entity's shape, asserted against the manifest and the tree.
//
// A move ticket has no new behaviour to test, so what is worth pinning is the
// shape the move is supposed to produce: the entity owns the tables the manifest
// gives it, no old lib/ or components/ path exists (ME-13 deleted the shims),
// every retreat route in app/ is a thin delegation, segment config stays
// in the app file
// (Next reads `dynamic`/`runtime` only from the route file's own `export const`
// declarations, never through a re-export — see checkExports in
// next/dist/build/analysis/get-page-static-info.js), the passport clean-up cron
// keeps its path, and the entity reaches company-os only through that entity's
// index.
//
// Collected by the root vitest.config.ts (`entities/**/*.test.ts`).
