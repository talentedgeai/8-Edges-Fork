// What a route needs from the file that mounts it, and cannot say itself.
//
// `app/` is generated from the entity route trees (scripts/gen-app-mounts.mjs).
// Almost everything about a mount is derivable — its path, and the names Next
// binds it by — but two things are not, because Next reads them by static
// analysis of the file in `app/` and will not see them through a re-export: the
// route-segment config, and the stylesheets whose cascade order against
// app/styles/* is part of the page.
//
// Each entity states them for its own routes in `entities/<name>/mounts.ts`,
// keyed by the route's path within the entity. They live in one file per entity
// rather than beside each route because 286 routes carry one and the repo's
// file-size ratchet is measured per file: a five-line declaration in each would
// have pushed four pages over their cap for no reader's benefit.
