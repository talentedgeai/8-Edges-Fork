 *
 *  - `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` was never checked. On a structured-output call
 *    that leaves truncated JSON, and the bare `JSON.parse` downstream throws a
 *    SyntaxError that reads like an API outage. It is named here instead, so a
 *    too-small budget is diagnosable from the stored ai_error.
 *  - `usage` was never read anywhere, so no route could be attributed a cost
 *    and prompt-cache hits could not be confirmed. Every call logs one line.

/**
 * The JSON schema sent to the model, derived from the Zod schema that will

 * One artifact, two jobs. The alternative — a hand-written `json_schema` const
 * beside a hand-written Zod "runtime mirror" of it — is what sixteen call sites
 * did before A.3, and two hand-synced artifacts are the drift ADR 0006 exists
 * to close.
 *
 * `zod/v4` is a subpath of the installed zod 3.25, not an upgrade. The emitter
 * only accepts v4 schema objects, so a model-output schema is authored with
 * `import { z } from "zod/v4"` while action inputs stay on the classic import.
 * Mixing the two versions inside one schema is what breaks; using each in its
 * own file is what the subpath is for.
 *
 * Two departures from the emitter's output, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - `$schema` is stripped. The structured-output API has no use for it, and
 *    leaving it in would make every schema differ from the hand-written one it
 *    replaces for a reason that is not about the shape.
 *  - Nothing else is rewritten. In particular `.nullable()` emits
 *    `anyOf: [{type:"X"}, {type:"null"}]` where the hand-written schemas wrote
 *    `type: ["X","null"]` — semantically identical, textually different on the
 *    wire, and confirmed against a live call before the sweep rather than
 *    assumed. If that ever regresses output quality, the fix is a rewrite here,
 *    which keeps one Zod artifact and the old wire format.
 *
 * Never pass `io: "input"`: it silently drops `additionalProperties: false`,
 * which is the part of the schema that stops the model inventing keys.
