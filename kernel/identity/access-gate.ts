// It is NOT a login. It carries no identity and confers no data access — it
// unlocks internal *content* (the private workflows library, a client's scope
// document) that is otherwise readable by anyone who guesses a URL. The point
// is that the code itself never reaches the browser and the cookie cannot be
// forged, which is what the previous `edge8_private_ok=1` client cookie could
// not offer: the literal `1` was trivially settable and the code shipped in the
// client bundle.
//
// The signing core lives in lib/signed-token.ts and is shared with the retreat
// guest-hub grant; the difference here is that the payload is a bare `scope`,
// so one module serves every gated area.
