// The Admin surface's information architecture: the slots, in display order.
//
// Three labelled sections (agreed 2026-08-09, see
// docs/product/eight-edges/eight-edges-engineering-plan.md): OPERATING SYSTEM
// points the company (the dashboard and the Edges pages), FOUR OFFICES runs it
// (the nested-by-office IA: every feature lives under a System inside an Office,
// see docs/product/four-offices-of-the-future.md), WORKSPACE configures it.
// Offices and Systems both collapse.
//
// This file names no entity and holds no rows. Each entity contributes its rows
// to a slot from its browser-safe door, and app/nav.ts — generated from the
// deployment — hands the shell the contributions of the entities installed here
// (ADR 0002). A slot nobody contributes to is not rendered.
