// The hand-written files under app/ — the root layout, the three surface
// shells, the auth callback — are the one place a deployment can still bundle
// an entity it did not install: they are not generated, so nothing removes an
// import of `@/entities/assistant` when assistant is left out. The minimal
// build's first run showed exactly that: the admin shell shipping the AI chat
// widget to a client who had not bought it, and the root layout pulling in the
// marketing site.
//
// This is a ratchet. Every such import is listed below with the shell it lives
// in; the list may only shrink. A new one fails here, and the right fix is the
// one the team shell got — a shell that follows its entity — or a contribution
// the composition root assembles from the installed entities, the way the
// navigation is.
